My name is Anton François. I recenctly finished a PhD in Applied Mathematics in the [MAP5 laboratory](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr) at Université Paris-Cité. My dissertation focused on diffeomorphic image registration, which allows for the comparison of healthy and glioblastoma-affected brain images. To do this, I used a method called Metamorphoses, which is inspired by LDDMM. [more about my Phd project here](https://antonfrancois.github.io/projects/1_project/)

I hold a Master Degree "[Mathematic, Modelisation and learning](https://math-info.u-paris.fr/master-mathematiques-et-applications/specialite-mathematiques-modelisation-apprentissage/)" with a major in image automatic processing. Before that, I also obtained an interdisciplinary degree at [CRI](https://www.learningplanetinstitute.org) focused on biology. I am passionate about the open source software mentality and knowledge sharing. I believe that a healthy and collaborative work environment is essential for success. I am a good programmer and I can lead research projects. I am also a good communicator and I am able to work effectively in teams.
