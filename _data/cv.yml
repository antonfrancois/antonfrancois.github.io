    - <h4>Shape Analysis</h4> which aims at comparing living objects, such as organs, by the amount of deformation needed to match their forms.
    - <h4>Fluid Dynamics.</h4> I needed to integrate over a system of partial differential equations similar to the Navier-Stocks one. I developed numerical schemes for my specific task.
    - <h4>Computationnal image Analysis.</h4> As I was processing MRI. One can note that it was the focus of my Master degree.
    - <h4>Medicine.</h4> At the center of my thesis application,  to acquire knowledge about Glioblastomas and their development. 
    - <h4>Ecology</h4> I have always been facinated by complex systems in interactions. Modelisation of such systems, and their sometimes chaotics behaviours, was one the first reason that led me to study mathematics.
